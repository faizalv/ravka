# Welcome to Project Ravka #

## What is "Ravka" tho?

**Ravka** is a problematic country in "Shadow and bone" series. _(and yes, I took that as the name for this project)_

This language uses non-formal Bahasa Indonesia as its syntax, the structure follows Golang, PHP, Java and every
language I know.

## The purpose

To understand **Golang** std library, really. Also, I want to learn the magic behind a programming language
interpreters (maybe also a compiler later) so I decided to build one my own. _(and for my portfolio)_

## Features

It can work on binary expression, comparison... and many more!

## Development

Since **Ravka** still in its "early stage", a lot of changes will be expected in this project, so be prepared if a
`module` will be created this morning and gone by the next week.
